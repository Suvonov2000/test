    <h1><q>Best practices</q>don't actually work.</h1>
    <pre>  I've written,<span style="color: rgb(58, 197, 197);">a few thousand words</span> on why traditional"semantic class names"are the 
   reason CSS is hard to maintain, but the truth is you're never going to believe me until you
    actually try it. If you can suppress the urge to retch long enough to give it a chance,I 
        really think you'll wonder how you ever worked with CSS any other way.</pre>
